Server-side use of the CRL
For client certificates, itâ€™s typically a server-side application (eg, Apache) that is doing the verification. 
This application needs to have local access to the CRL.

You can add the SSLCARevocationPath directive to Apache configuration and copy the CRL to web server. 
The next time that user with revoked certificate connects to the web server, 
Apache will check his client certificate against the CRL and deny access.

Similarly, OpenVPN has a crl-verify directive so that it can block clients that have had their certificates revoked.
