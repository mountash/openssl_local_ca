Client-side use of the CRL
For server certificates, itâ€™s typically a client-side application (eg, a web browser) that performs the verification. 
This application must have remote access to the CRL.

If a certificate was signed with an extension that includes crlDistributionPoints, 
a client-side application can read this information and fetch the CRL from the specified location.

The CRL distribution points are visible in the certificate X509v3 details.
